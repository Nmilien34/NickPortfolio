      "description": "I landed in the US from Haiti in 2015 and immediately realized one thing: nothing here is given, everything is earned. While I was navigating high school and learning English, I wasn't just trying to fit in—I was trying to catch up. Got my first job at 16 working at the mall which I then quit to go work at KFC, which paid a lot more. I built my first real community here, made friends who helped me navigate the culture, and set a baseline for the work ethic that would define the next decade of my life. Also played lots of soccer."

      "description": "Prom and graduation were coming up, and I needed cash. So I quit KFC and replaced it with two jobs: Amazon Warehouse after school and selling furniture at Big Lots on weekends. With the money I was making, I started buying distressed cars at auctions, fixing them up, and flipping them for a profit. Between passing the ASVAB while barely speaking English, getting a decent SAT score without studying, and graduating in May 2019, I learned that I could outwork almost anyone, as long as the goal was clear."

      "title": "Three Jobs & A Dream",
      "description": "I got into schools like Penn State, NYIT, and Pace, and was waitlisted by UPenn and Columbia, but I chose NJIT for engineering and the in-state tuition. To prepare for the cost, I just worked more. I left Amazon but started balancing three simultaneous jobs at Big Lots, BJ's, and Macy's while assembling furniture for friends on the side. I barely had a free minute, but I squeezed in community college classes to get a head start on my degree. It was exhausting, but it taught me time management in a way no classroom ever could."

      "description": "I made the decision to quit my jobs and focus entirely on entrepreneurship. When COVID hit and classes went virtual, I suddenly had a lot more time to work and teach myself everything I could. I hustled hard. I went full-time entrepreneur. I scaled my car-flipping business to over $300k in inventory, managed a jewelry store with a $1.1M operating budget completely on my own, and even became a regional partner for Bird Scooters, running logistics across two cities. It was a crash course in operations, logistics, and real-world P&L management. With the profits, I bought land in Haiti as a gift for my mom."

      "title": "Realizing the Ceiling",
      "description": "I hit a point where I realized physical businesses scale linearly, but software scales exponentially. I formalized my furniture business into \"Popfame\" and built a team of 30 people, including a dev team in Pakistan to build an on-demand service app. I joined every incubator I could find—Microsoft for Startups, AWS Activate, Rutgers BLT. We also were working with Amazon and HandyBuddy to bring in more service volume, but I realized that managing a massive team without a strong tech foundation was painful. I needed to stop just managing tech and start building it."

      "description": "The \"Real Life\" MBA. This was the year everything changed. I realized I needed to be in rooms with people smarter than me, so I teamed up with Allen Yao from Wharton and Liam Du from Cornell, and together we built a team of eight across MIT, Harvard, and Georgia Tech and Upenn. We raised $150k, got into the Alchemist Accelerator, and processed $80k in GMV connecting homeowners to service providers. But the retention wasn't there. We were grinding door-to-door sales for low-margin services, and in November we made the hard, mature call to shut it down. It hurt—but it taught me the most important lesson in tech: Verify the problem before you build the solution."

    "engineer": {
      "title": "The Engineer",
      "description": "After Lawnstack, I decided to get as technical as possible. I locked in for a month—200+ hours—teaching myself TypeScript and Vibe Coding. Then I teamed up with my former CTO to build Boltzman AI, which hit 3k users before we pivoted into Voice AI. Now I'm running a profitable Voice AI receptionist service for restaurants. I hit a peak of ~$5k MRR with ~70% margins as a solopreneur wearing every hat. I'm dealing with some churn right now, but I've learned a ton in the process—from professors and mentors at Princeton, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and more. And now, I'm graduating this December with my engineering degree—not just as a student, but as a builder who has raised VC money, managed millions, failed fast, and learned to code his own way out."
